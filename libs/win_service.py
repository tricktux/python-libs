SMWinservice
by Davide Mastromatteo

Base class to create winservice in Python
-----------------------------------------

Instructions:

0. `pip install pywin32`
0.1 Add to the SYSTEM PATH variable:
    - path to python.exe
    - path to pythonservice.exe: Lib\win32
    - path to pywintypes37.dll: Lib\pywin32_system32
0.2 Also had to modify python37._pth to add:
    - Lib/site-packages/win32
    - Lib/site-packages/win32/lib
1. Just create a new class that inherits from this base class
2. Define into the new class the variables
   _svc_name_ = "nameOfWinservice"
   _svc_display_name_ = "name of the Winservice that will be displayed in scm"
   _svc_description_ = "description of the Winservice that will be displayed in scm"
3. Override the three main methods:
    def start(self) : if you need to do something at the service initialization.
                      A good idea is to put here the inizialization of the running condition
    def stop(self)  : if you need to do something just before the service is stopped.
                      A good idea is to put here the invalidation of the running condition
    def main(self)  : your actual run loop. Just create a loop based on your running condition
4. Define the entry point of your module calling the method "parse_command_line" of the new class
5. Enjoy
